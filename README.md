### Hello, my name is Agustina. 🤓

![women developer](https://github.com/AgustinaHeredia/AgustinaHeredia/assets/119814051/db1e20bc-86a1-4ee2-bdb9-137f88c47cca)


I am a female programmer.
When I was young, I didn't want to be a programmer, but in 2021 I discovered that I love programming. And now that I'm older, I want to be one with all my strength.

And to become a good programmer, I started studying at IT Adademy from Barcelona Activa, a Java Backend Bootcamp, and once finished, since 2023 I have been a student at 42 Barcelona.

##  💻 I’m currently learning in [42Barcelona](https://www.42barcelona.com/es)  :42:
