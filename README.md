I am a female programmer.
When I was young, I didn't want to be a programmer, but in 2021 I discovered that I love programming. And now that I'm older, I want to be one with all my strength.

And to become a good programmer, I started studying at IT Adademy from Barcelona Activa, a Java Backend Bootcamp, and once finished, since 2023 I have been a student at 42 Barcelona.

## languages and tools:

Java - Spring Boots - C - C++ - Html - Python - MySQL - MongoDB - Kotlin - Git - Indesing - Ilustrator - Photoshop
